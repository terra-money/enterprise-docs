# What is Enterprise?

Enterprise is a no-code tool for organizing, creating, and maintaining [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](./about.mdx) on the Terra blockchain. With Enterprise, you can create [multisig wallets](./about.mdx#multisig-daos), organize communities around [NFTs](./about.mdx#nft-daos) and [tokens](./about.mdx#token-daos), and manage the [governance of DAOs](./governance.mdx) all in a single interface. 

## Why use Enterprise?

Enterprise was created with one goal in mind: to make DAOs easier to manage. Whether you are creating a new DAO or importing an existing one, Enterprise has all the tools you need in one place. 

DAO creation and management used to be a cumbersome process that required in-depth technical knowledge. Traditionally, the options for DAO creators were to either build complex and functional DAO management tools from scratch or resort to off-chain solutions. Given the technical barriers, the off-chain approach was often chosen, leading to centralization and a lack of transparency. Enterprise provides users with robust and intuitive DAO management tooling and promotes governance transparency within the Terra ecosystem.
