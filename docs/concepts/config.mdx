# Configurations and parameters

When creating a DAO, you will be required to input parameters outlining the DAO. Read this section carefully to understand the different aspects of a DAO. 

<Admonition type="caution" title="Updating parameters">

After creation, [general parameters](#general-parameters) can only be updated using a [DAO configuration proposal](./governance.mdx#dao-configuration-proposals). 

</Admonition>

## General parameters

All DAOs require the following configuration parameters: 

#### Name

The name of your DAO. This name will be public and appear on the DAO page. 

#### Logo URL

The URL of a logo image.

#### Social Media Links

Use this section to input your social media handles and URLs. Social media is a great way for DAOs to build and update a community. 

### Governance configuration

In addition to the parameters above, all DAOs require the following governance parameters.


{/* This section is copied from governance.mdx It must be updated in that location as well */}

#### Threshold

The percentage of yes votes required to pass a proposal. 

$$
\frac{Number\,of\,Yes\,votes}{Yes\, + No\,votes} \ge Threshold
$$

#### Quorum 

The minimum number of staked tokens, NFTs, or [multisig votes](#weight-and-threshold) that need to vote for an election to be valid, expressed as a percentage of total staked token supply. Proposals that don't meet quorum fail, regardless of the vote outcome. 

$$
\frac{Number\,of\,Yes\,votes + No\,votes + Abstain\,votes}{Total\,possible\,votes} \ge Quorum
$$

#### Unlocking period 

The period of time it takes for a staked token to become unstaked. Tokens in the unstaking phase cannot be used to cast a vote. Once the unstaking period is over, the owner can claim them. 

#### Vote duration

The period of time during which a user can vote on a proposal. When a proposal is created, the vote duration starts. Once the vote duration is reached, the votes are tallied and the proposal either passes or fails. No votes can be cast after the voting period. 

## Specific parameters

Different DAOs will require specific parameters according to the DAO's type. 

### Multisig parameters

In addition to the [general parameters](#general-parameters), multisig DAOs contain the following specific parameter.

#### Weight and threshold

When creating a multisig DAO, each owner's wallet address is input along with a weight. The weight specifies the voting power of a wallet. A wallet with a weight of _`20`_ has twice as much voting power as a wallet with a weight of _`10`_. You can think of weights as the number of votes given to a wallet. Transactions are considered fully signed and will pass when the combined weight of the signers is greater than the threshold percentage of the total weights.

$$
\frac{Combined\,weight\,of\,signed\,members}{Total\,weight\,of\,all\,members} \ge Threshold
$$

**Example**:

A multisig DAO creates a proposal. The multisig has 5 members and a threshold of 66%:

- _`wallet1 weight=30`_
- _`wallet2 weight=10`_
- _`wallet3 weight=15`_
- _`wallet4 weight=25`_
- _`wallet5 weight=20`_

In this example, the _`total_weight`_ is _`100`_.
To pass, the wallets that vote to sign would need a combined weight greater than _`66`_.

If wallets 1-4 vote by signing the proposed transaction, their combined weight would be _`80`_, and the proposal would pass. 

$$
\frac{80}{100} \ge 66\%
$$

### NFT DAO parameters


In addition to the [general parameters](#general-parameters), NFT Community DAOs contain the following specific parameters.

#### NFT Name

The name of the NFT you want to create. 

#### NFT Symbol

A Symbol for your NFT. This is usually 4 letters or fewer. 

#### NFT Minter

The address for the NFT minter contract. Enterprise does not supply an NFT minting contract, and this must be provided by the user.  

<Admonition type="tip" title="Using an existing NFT collection">

You can make a DAO around an existing NFT collection by inputting the NFT address of the existing collection. Anyone in possession of the NFTs in that collection can be a member of the DAO. 

</Admonition>


### Token DAO parameters

In addition to the [general parameters](#general-parameters), Token Community DAOs contain the following specific parameters.

#### Token Name
The name of your new token. 

#### Token Symbol
A symbol for your new token. Usually a maximum of four characters. 

#### Decimals

The number of decimal places your token should be generated with. This defines the smallest possible unit of the token. For instance, a single decimal place will mean the smallest unit of your token will be `.1`. 

#### Initial token distribution

To mint the new DAOs token, you must specify an address to send the token to, and an amount of the token to mint and send. You can add multiple addresses and amounts. Once a DAO has been created, the original genesis distribution of the token cannot be changed. 

<Admonition type="tip" title="Using an existing Token">

You can make a DAO around an existing token by inputting the existing token address. Anyone in possession of the existing token can be a member of the DAO.

</Admonition>

#### Description

A description of the token. 

#### Logo URL

A URL for the token's logo image. 

#### Marketing Owner Address

The wallet address of the marketing owner. This wallet can change DAO token's marketing information, such as description and logo.

#### Project

The name of your project. 

## Updating configurations

The General Parameters of a DAO can be updated by creating and passing a [DAO configuration proposal](./governance.mdx#dao-configuration-proposals).
