# Register a DAO with FeeShare

The [x/FeeShare module](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-feeshare) on the Terra blockchain allows smart contracts to receive a portion of the gas fees generated by interactions with the contract. For more information on this module, visit the [FeeShare spec](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-feeshare). To learn how to register a smart contract with feeshare, visit the [registration guide](https://docs.terra.money/develop/guides/register-fee-share/). 

To register a contract with the FeeShare module, DAOs will need to specify a contract they want to register and an address they want a portion of generated fees sent to called the Withdrawer address. Any fees generated by an interaction with the registered contract will be portioned and distributed to the Withdrawer address. 

Because the admin of an Enterprise DAO contract is the DAO itself, any address can be set as the Withdrawer address.  This address could be the treasury address or any other address the DAO chooses. 

<Admonition type="danger" title="Setting a withdrawal address">

It is not recommended to use the distributor address as the withdrawal at this time as it does not distribute funds unless there's a `{"distribute":{}}` message included with the send. This will be remedied in the next update.

## DAO registration guide

Follow this guide to register your DAO's contracts with the FeeShare module. 

<Admonition type="tip" title="Registering each contract">

You will have to submit this proposal each time you want to register a contract for your DAO, including the DAO, distributor, and token contracts, as long as the DAO created the token or is the admin of the contract.  A DAO can only register a contract it is the admin of.
