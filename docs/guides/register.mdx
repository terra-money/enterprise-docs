## Register a DAO with FeeShare

Terra's [x/FeeShare module](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-feeshare) allows smart contracts to receive a portion of the gas fees generated by interactions with the contract. For more information on this module, visit the [FeeShare spec](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-feeshare). To learn how to register a smart contract with feeshare, visit the [registration guide](https://docs.terra.money/develop/guides/register-fee-share/). 

## DAO registration guide

To register an Enterprise DAO with Terra's FeeShare module, you will need to use the DAO’s contract address on the DAO’s home page.

Because the admin of an Enterprise DAO contract is the DAO itself, any address can be set as the withdrawal address.  This address could be the distributor address, treasury address, or any other address the DAO chooses.

The following example shows a stargate message that can be inserted into an execute proposal to register an Enterprise DAO contract. Note that the payload, including the contract address, deployer address, and withdrawer address need to be encoded into a protobuf to create a stargate message.

```js Example.json
{“stargate”:{“type_url”:“/juno.feeshare.v1.MsgRegisterFeeShare”,“value”:“CkB0ZXJyYTF1M3o0MmZwY3R1aGg4bXJhbno0dGF0YWNxaHR5NmE4eWs3bDV3dmo3ZHNoc3V5dGNtczJxZGE0ZjV4EkB0ZXJyYTF1M3o0MmZwY3R1aGg4bXJhbno0dGF0YWNxaHR5NmE4eWs3bDV3dmo3ZHNoc3V5dGNtczJxZGE0ZjV4Gix0ZXJyYTF5ZnEyd3dzeHc3YXV4cDA4ZzBjY3ozdXlrdnNjMHM0d2txMHAzbQ==“}}
