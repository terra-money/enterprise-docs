# Stake, unstake, and claim

In order to create or vote on a proposal, NFT and Token DAO members must stake their tokens. Staking locks your tokens for a set period of time and ensures that only those with a vested interest in the DAO can participate. For more information on staking, visit the [Governance and staking page](../concepts/governance.mdx).

2. To connect your wallet to Enterprise, click the wallet icon in the upper right corner of the screen. 

3. Select **Station Wallet**. 

4. If needed, click **approve** in the Station extension. 

You are now connected to your wallet. Before you continue, make sure your [network is set to the **mainnet**](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/networks).
