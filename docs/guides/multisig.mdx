# Create a Multisig DAO

Follow the steps below to [create a new multisig DAO](#create-a-new-multisig-dao) or [create a DAO from an existing multisig wallet](#create-a-dao-using-an-existing-multisig). For more info on Multisig wallets, visit the [concepts page](../concepts/about.mdx#multisig-daos).

## Prerequisites

Before you can create a multisig DAO, make sure you have completed the following:
- Download Google Chrome
- Install [the Station Chrome Extension](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/download/station-extension)
- At least two [Terra wallet addresses](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/download/station-extension#create-a-wallet)

## Connect your wallet to Enterprise

1. Sign in to your Station wallet using the [Station Browser Extension](https://setup-station.terra.money/). 

2. To connect your wallet to Enterprise, click the wallet icon in the upper right corner of the screen. 

3. Select **Station Wallet**. 

4. If needed, click **approve** in the Station extension. 

You are now connected to your wallet. Before you continue, make sure your [network is set to the **mainnet**](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/networks).

## Create a new Multisig DAO

2. Input a name for your wallet and upload a logo. Click **Next**.

3. Add the addresses of the wallets you want to be part of the multisig account and input their [weights](../concepts/config.mdx#weight-and-threshold). Click **Next**.

4. Define your [threshold](../concepts/config.mdx#weight-and-threshold), [quorum](../concepts/config.mdx#quorum) and [vote duration parameters](../concepts/config.mdx#vote-duration). Click **Next**.
