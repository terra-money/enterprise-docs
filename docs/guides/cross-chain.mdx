# Cross-chain treasuries

Enterprise DAOs can manage treasuries across Cosmos chains directly from the Enterprise app. Cross-chain treasuries are DAO treasury addresses available on supported chains that can be controlled from your dao. 

Currently, Enterprise DAO is supported on the following chains:
- [Terra](https://www.terra.money/)
- [Migaloo](https://docs.migaloo.zone/)

## Deploy a cross-chain treasury

You can deploy your treasury cross-chain by initiating a governance proposal in your DAO. 

1. Upgrade your DAO (only applicable to existing DAOs) to the latest version.  Submit an “Upgrade” proposal, and [pass it through the normal governance process](./governance.mdx) by having your members vote on it.

2. Now you can submit a cross-chain treasury proposal. Click on “New Proposal” on the DAO’s **Proposals** page.

3. On the new proposal page, select the **Deploy cross-chain treasury** proposal type and click **Next**.

4. Fill in the proposal details and select which chain you’d like your cross-chain treasury to be deployed to. Click **Create** to submit the proposal and sign the transaction in your Station wallet.

5. [Pass the proposals through the normal governance process](./governance.mdx) by having your members vote on it. After successfully passing, you can return to the proposal page to execute the proposal.

6. Your cross-chain treasury is now deployed. You should be able to see the address for your new cross-chain treasury on the DAO home page.

## Manage cross-chain treasuries

You can [Create proposals](./governance.mdx) to spend your cross-chain assets, stake them, or deploy them into cross-chain apps.

To spend your cross-chain treasury, create a treasury spend proposal. On the proposal creation page, select a chain to spend the treasury from that chain. 

## Create a DAO using an IBC denom

You can create a DAO using an existing IBC denom by entering the denom address during DAO creation. 

Follow the [token DAO creation guide](./token.mdx), and when the app asks if you have an existing token, click **Yes, find my Token**, and then select **Native**. Enter the address of your IBC denom and continue the creation process.
