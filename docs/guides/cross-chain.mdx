# Cross-chain treasuries

Enterprise DAOs can manage treasuries across Cosmos chains directly from the Enterprise app. Cross-chain treasuries are DAO treasury addresses available on supported chains that can be controlled from your dao. 

Currently, Enterprise DAO is supported on the following chains:
- Terra
- Migaloo

## Deploy a cross-chain treasury

You can deploy your treasury cross-chain by initiating a governance proposal in your DAO. 

1. Upgrade your DAO (only applicable to existing DAOs).  Submit an “Upgrade” proposal, and [pass it through the normal governance process](./governance.mdx) by having your members vote on it.

2. Submit a cross-chain treasury proposal. Click on “New Proposal” on the DAO’s page, select the “Deploy cross-chain treasury” proposal type, and select where you’d like your cross-chain treasury to be deployed. [pass it through the normal governance process](./governance.mdx) by having your members vote on it and execute the proposal.

3. Your cross-chain treasury is now deployed. You should be able to see the address for your new cross-chain treasury on the DAO home page.

## Manage cross-chain treasuries

You can [Create proposals](./governance.mdx) to spend your cross-chain assets, stake them, or deploy them into cross-chain apps.

To spend your cross-chain treasury, create a treasury spend proposal. On the proposal creation page, select a chain to spend the treasury from that chain. 

## Create a DAO using an IBC denom

You can create a DAO using an existing IBC denom by entering the denom address during DAO creation. 

Follow the [token DAO creation guide](./token.mdx), and when the app asks if you have an existing token, click **Yes, find my Token** and then specify the asset type as **Denom**. Enter the address of your IBC denom and continue the creation process.
