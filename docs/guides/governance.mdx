# Proposals and voting

Governance is an important part of a DAO's operation, relying on the creation of proposals and voting. To learn more about proposals and voting, visit the [Governance page](../concepts/governance.mdx). Use this guide to perform governance activities for your DAO. 

## Connect your wallet to Enterprise

1. Sign in to your Station wallet using the [Station Browser Extension](https://setup.station.money). 

2. To connect your wallet to Enterprise, click the wallet icon in the upper right corner of the screen. 

3. Select **Station Wallet**. 

4. If needed, click **approve** in the Station extension. 

You are now connected to your wallet. Before you continue, make sure your network is set to the **mainnet**.

## Create a proposal

<Admonition type="caution" title="Staking requirement">

NFT and Token DAOs require users to stake assets before they can create or vote on a proposal. To learn more about governance and staking, visit the [Governance page](../concepts/governance.mdx). To learn how to stake your tokens or NFTs, visit [the staking guide](./stake.mdx).

</Admonition>

1. To create a proposal, visit your DAO's overview page on the Enterprise web app. 

2. Below your DAO's name, click **Proposals**.

3. Click the **New Proposal** button.

4. Select whether to create a [Text proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals), [DAO Configuration proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals), [DAO Upgrade proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals), [Update whitelisted assets proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals), [Execute message proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals) or a [Update multisig member proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals)

5. Type in a title and a description for your proposal. Depending on the proposal you're creating, you'll need to update different parameters. For [execute message proposals](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals), you'll need to provide a valid Cosmos/Wasm message. Refer to the [Message Templates](./messages.mdx) section for examples of supported messages.

6. Click **Create**. 

5. Click **Post** in your Station Browser Extension to sign the transaction. 

Congratulations! You've just made a DAO proposal! 

Once your proposal passes successfully, be sure to [execute the message](#execute-a-proposal) and put any changes into effect.

## Execute a proposal

Once a proposal passes, the proposer must execute its proposal message to put into effect any changes from the proposal. Proposals do not automatically execute, and execution must be done manually. Text proposals can not be executed, as they contain no update or execute message. 

1. Below your DAO's name, click **Proposals**.

2. Click on a proposal that has passed. 

3. Click the **Execute** button. 

4. Sign the transaction in your browser extension.
