# Enterprise Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for Enterprise, a next-generation DAO management platform.

## What is Enterprise?

Enterprise is a no-code tool for organizing, creating, and maintaining Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Terra blockchain. With Enterprise, you can create [multisig wallets](./concepts/about.mdx#multisig-daos), organize communities around [NFTs](./concepts/about.mdx#nft-community-daos) and [tokens](./concepts/about.mdx#community-token-daos), and manage the [governance of DAOs](./concepts/governance.mdx) all in a single interface. 


## Why Enterprise?

Enterprise was created with one goal in mind: to make DAOs easier to manage. Whether you are creating a new DAO or importing an existing one, Enterprise has all the tools you need in one place. 

DAO creation and management used to be a cumbersome process that required in-depth technical knowledge. Traditionally, the options for DAO creators were to either build complex and functional DAO management tools from scratch or resort to off-chain solutions. Given the technical barriers, the off-chain approach was often chosen, leading to centralization and a lack of transparency. Enterprise provides users with a robust and intuitive DAO management tooling and promote governance transparency within the Terra ecosystem.
