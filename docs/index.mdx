# Enterprise DAO Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for Enterprise DAO, a no-code tool for organizing, creating, and maintaining [cross-chain DAOs](./concepts/about.mdx). With Enterprise, you can create [multisig wallets](./concepts/about.mdx#multisig-daos), organize communities around [NFTs](./concepts/about.mdx#nft-daos) and [tokens](./concepts/about.mdx#token-daos), and manage the [governance of DAOs](./concepts/governance.mdx) all in a single interface.
