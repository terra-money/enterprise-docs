# Queries

This section outlines the various query messages for Enterprise. 

<CH.Scrollycoding>

## DaoInfo

Returns all available info on a particular DAO. 

- _`dao_membership_contract`_ refers to the contract that is used to calculate DAO membership. 
- _`dao_code_version`_ is the version of the Enterprise code that the DAO is currently running.

<CH.Code>
```rust Query
DaoInfo {}
```
---
```rust Response
struct DaoInfoResponse {
    pub metadata: DaoMetadata,
    pub gov_config: DaoGovConfig,
    pub dao_type: DaoType,
    pub dao_membership_contract: Addr,
    pub dao_code_version: Uint64,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## QueryMemberInfoMsg

Returns the voting power or weight of a DAO member. 

- _`member_address`_: The address of a particular DAO member. 

- _`voting_power`_: The weight of the requested DAO member expressed as a decimal. This query returns 0 if the address is not a member of the DAO. 

For example, a voting power of 0.31 means that the member holds 31% of available votes.

<CH.Code>
```rust Query
struct QueryMemberInfoMsg {
    member_address: String,
}
```
---
```rust Response
struct MemberInfoResponse {
    pub voting_power: Decimal,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## AssetWhitelist

Returns a list of a DAOs current whitelisted assets. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Query
    AssetWhitelist {}
```
---

```rust Response
struct AssetWhitelistResponse {
    pub assets: Vec<AssetInfo>,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

### NftWhitelistResponse

The whitelist response for an NFT DAO. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Query
    AssetWhitelist {}
```
---
```rust Response
struct NftWhitelistResponse {
		pub nfts: Vec<Addr>,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## ProposalParams

Returns the parameters for a single proposal. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Query
struct ProposalParams {
    pub proposal_id: ProposalId,
}
```
---
```rust Response
struct ProposalResponse {
    pub proposal: Proposal,

		/// means this is serialized as an array of (int, String)
		/// where the String is a string representation of unsigned 128 integer
    #[schemars(with = "Vec<(u8, Uint128)>")]
    #[serde_as(as = "Vec<(_, _)>")]
    /// Total vote-count (value) for each outcome (key).
    pub results: BTreeMap<u8, u128>,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## ProposalStatusParams

Returns all proposals. Proposal types can be specified to filter by a proposal's status. 

<CH.Code>
```rust Query
struct ProposalsParams {
    /// Optional proposal status to filter for.
    pub filter: Option<ProposalStatusFilter>,
    pub start_after: Option<ProposalId>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
}

enum ProposalStatusFilter {
    InProgress,
    Passed,
    Rejected,
}
```
---
```rust Response
struct ProposalsResponse {
    pub proposals: Vec<ProposalResponse>,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## ProposalStatusParams

Returns the status parameters of a proposal, including the status, expiration time, and the total vote-count (value) for each outcome (key).


<CH.Code>
```rust Query
struct ProposalStatusParams {
    pub proposal_id: ProposalId,
}
```
---
```rust Response
struct ProposalStatusResponse {
    pub status: ProposalStatus,
    pub expires: Expiration,

    pub results: BTreeMap<u8, u128>,
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

## PollVoterParams

Returns the [vote outcome](./messages.mdx#castvotemsg) and number of votes of a specific DAO member given a poll id and an address. 
<CH.Code>

```rust
struct PollVoterParams {
    pub poll_id: Uint64,
    pub voter_addr: String,
}
```
---
```rust
struct PollVoterResponse {
    pub vote: Option<Vote>,
}

struct Vote {
    pub poll_id: PollId,
    pub voter: Addr,
    /// The outcome voted for, 0-indexed.
    pub outcome: u8,
    /// Number of votes on the outcome.
    pub amount: u128,
}
```
</CH.Code>
